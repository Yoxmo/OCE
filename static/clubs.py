"Purpose_Statement" : "The Ohio State A Kid Again Club is a student organization that was created to serve the local Columbus chapter of A Kid Again.A Kid Again is a national organization that focuses on providing hope, happiness, and healing to families who are raising children with chronic illnesses. Many of these families allocate most of their time and funds to providing treatment for their child, so they don't have many opportunities to enjoy worry-free family fun. The A Kid Again organization sponsors these families on various events such as trips to theme parks, concerts, sporting events, restaurant dinners, and seasonal parties, so that the children of this program can forget their worries for a while and feel like a kid again. In addition, volunteers with the organization dedicate time to easing the pain of these children through hospital visits and other friendly interactions, such as a pen-pal letter exchange. As an extension of the main Columbus chapter, students in the OSU A Kid Again Club focus on serving the Columbus Chapter and on forming our own, campus based, support system for the A Kid Again families.The chapter accepts new members year round, through an application process. Applicants must submit an application to the Columbus Chapter and pass a background test. The Ohio State club requires annual dues ($15 for first time members and $10 for returning students) to cover club operations. Each member will receive an A Kid Again t-shirt when dues are paid.Students interested in becoming a part of the chapter should send an email to akidagainosu@gmail.com expressing their interest and requesting an application.",

"Purpose_Statement" : "History - Alpha Pi Mu was the brainchild of James T. French, who in 1949 was a senior industrial Engineering student at Georgia Institute of Technology. Nine students, chosen through their affiliation with the Georgia Tech chapter of Tau Beta Pi, constituted the original membership of Alpha Pi Mu. In 1959, full membership in the Association of College Honor Societies (ACHS) was attained. Alpha Pi Mu's association with ACHS signifies that it is the only nationally recognized industrial engineering honor society. Chapters now exist in almost every major university that possesses an accredited industrial engineering program.Mission - While high academic interests and abilities are required for membership, the society's overall goals are much broader. Its purpose is to:- Recognize top junior and senior industrial engineering students for their academic achievements- Increase professional development among members- Promote networking among faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students- Have fun!Membership Opportunities - EmploymentCompanies give added consideration to honor society members who have already demonstrated that they have something extra.LeadershipEmployers look for signs of potential leadership characteristics among the students they interview. Officer positions and the worthwhile projects carried out by the chapter provide excellent opportunities for the acquisition of leadership experience and the satisfaction of accomplishment.Professional ActivitiesProgress of the industrial engineering profession is closely linked to the growth and development of the Institute of Industrial Engineers (IIE). Alpha Pi Mu has long had close ties with and has cooperated fully with IIE. These organizations have a number of officers and members who are active in both groups, affording close liaison and mutual help.Membership QualificationsExcellence, as demonstrated by scholarship, leadership, integrity and sociability are the chief requirements. The Alpha Pi Mu National Constitution states that only those ranked in the upper one-fifth of the junior class or the upper one-third of the senior class may be considered for membership. Graduate students who have demonstrated exceptional scholarly achievement may, upon nomination by the department head, be considered for membership.Selected candidates can choose whether or not to join.",

We encourage exposure and training in these techniques by implementing ultrasound-focused Clinical, Administrative, Research, and Education (CARE) initiatives in the Department of Anesthesiology. Initiatives include proctoring didactic ultrasound training sessions, hosting journal club sessions, and organizing student-led research projects. The organization encourages leadership over the four years of medical school, and ultrasound projects across all four CARE domains are passed on from year to year. Ultimately, we aim to promote widespread adoption of POCUS within Anesthesiology and improve quality and efficacy of patient care.",

As part of our programing we will continue our educational programs and extensive mentorship for elementary, middle, high school and premedical students throughout Ohio. Our organization is also devoted to educational topics that emphasize the need for consistent patient-doctor relationships among adults. There are studies that prove preventative care improves quality of life and health outcomes, and we plan to address these concerns particularly of note in the minority communities as these communities demonstrate significant lack of continuity care leading to more morbidity and mortality.",

We aim to take our meeting discussions deeper than the typical rhetoric of barbie dolls and social media. With this in mind, meeting themes surround body image, self-love, wellness, and the stigma surrounding eating disorders.We aim to accomplish these goals through meetings every other week, social events, collaborations with other student orgs, and the coordination of the Columbus, OH, National Eating Disorders Assosiation (NEDA) Walk each spring. In 2019, we raised over $30,000 for research and treatment of eating disorders.",

"Purpose_Statement" : "The goal of Buckeye Language Exchange is to promote fluency and interest in foreign languages. This organization will achieve this by matching students who want to learn and practice each other’s languages to participate in a semester long (or potentially longer at the students’ discretion) language exchange that promotes writing, speaking, and conversational practice. This club should serve as the bridge between the language knowledge you learn in the classroom, and the fluency you can bring to the workplace in your future career. Many students grow to intermediate fluency in the respective languages that they are learning, however many stop at that level as they don’t receive the conversation practice they need to improve to higher fluency. This club aims to retain many language learners in their journeys to fluency through conversation practice, in hopes that these students eventually grow to be able to use multiple languages in their future careers and lives. This organization’s mission is exactly in line with Ohio State’s values, as it has the potential to create future influential leaders, and it educates students on the importance of cultural and linguistic diversity in the workplace.",

"Purpose_Statement" : "The purpose of Consilience: The CCBS Student Organization is to create a forum for interdisciplinary dialogue amongst undergraduate, graduate, and post doc students. It is our belief that many of the scientific questions posed by the different disciplines reflect different approaches to the same underlying phenomena, rather than isolated queries unique to any particular discipline. It can only benefit our understanding of the underlying phenomena if we are exposed to the different scientific approaches used by fields outside of our own. Furthermore, it is important to develop the valuable skill of explaining, in an intelligible manner, what one is working on, to intelligent people outside of one’s own discipline. Consilience: The CCBS Student Organization will help to facilitate cross-disciplinary collaborative projects aimed at combining different scientific approaches to understand the underlying phenomena.

"Status" : "Pending",
 
"Purpose_Statement" : "As future physicians, it is our duty to explore, gather, and process the novel information which consciousness research is shedding a light upon. As students of The Ohio State University College of Medicine, it is our desire to lead our generation of student physicians as this emerging medical revolution begins to make a noticeable impact across the world.  The research being done at renowned institutions, such as the John Hopkins Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research, as well as the influence of the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), is bringing about a revolution across a spectrum of medical fields. The following statements further relay what we aim to gain as a medical student organization invested in this topic: -Furthering our understanding of human consciousness will certainly inspire positive changes to our understanding of the patient-physician relationship. It will also facilitate an increased appreciation for, and understanding of, holistic human health. -We would like to seize this rare opportunity to witness medical research directly translating into changed laws and policies.  -We would like to further explore how/why the mechanisms targeted by these unconventional treatments require entirely new metrics for data collection, and how researchers are coming up with these new metrics. -We are hoping to discuss how this emerging field of research can help doctors gain insight into the relationship between biological/physiological pathologies and mental perspectives.  -We trust that the exploration of novel ideas associated with the topic of consciousness will further empower and equip student physicians to bridge their own subjective perspectives of abstract ideas, such as those of empathy and implicit biases, to a more objective understanding of such topics. These are just a few reasons, among many others, as to why we believe this subject deserves its own interest group, despite its overlap with psychiatry, integrative medicine, neurology, gastroenterology, epigenetics, preventative medicine, and public health, among other things.",

Lastly, we want to document the life stories of those with dementia. This way, for as long as they forget, we will always remember them. We are excited to have two established partnerships with The Alzheimers Association and The Kemper House to help us serve our purpose. Though clinical service hours are collected through our volunteer experiences, we want to ensure that our volunteers are seeking much more than just a resume builder in our program.",

"Purpose_Statement" : "D3 provides an environment where driven students can come together into groups to build and launch a product in a semester.  Those accepted will split off into groups of 3–5 (composed of designers, coders, business, etc.) and start the design-develop-deploy process from the idea stage. Each semester culminates with Demo Night, our flagship event where all groups launch their products, beta tests, or new features. Our groups will pitch to a large audience of Columbus entrepreneurs, industry professionals, investors, students, and professors. Throughout the semester, D3 curates a schedule of speakers, workshops, practice pitches, hack nights, and build sessions. Due to a very competitive past few semesters, we can only accept about 50 new people per semester. Applications are due after the involvement fair and our information session. Of those accepted, we set aside approximately 40% of spots for groups with a product already - those who would like to build a new feature or fine-tune their business.Our members have high expectations of us, and we have high expectations of our members. Since we can't accept everybody, we prioritize students who are driven, interdisciplinary, and willing to learn new skills. We encourage students who are not admitted to apply again in the following semester.Ultimately, D3 gives members the tools to build a business, app, website, or product they're extremely proud of - in a single semester. Come innovate with us.",

"Purpose_Statement" : "Echo Chinese Student Organization (Echo) is a nonprofit registered student organization at the Ohio State University established by enthusiastic Buckeye Chinese international students in 2013. It is an organization dedicated to helping international Buckeyes to adjust to the new living/social/studying environment at the Ohio State University and also helping them to get a better sense of belonging and engaging to the OSU life and community. At the same time, the Echo is always willing to provide international students with a way to embrace diversity and become more engaged.For years, we hold some events, likes The Voice of OSU, Lunar New Year Festival, E-Sport Competition and so on. These events and activities provide international students a way to broaden their horizons to a large extent. At the same time, we also have our own band, the Echo Band, and the dancer group D.I.V.A, which are the two famous symbols of the Echo Studio. In October 2018. the final battle of 'The Voice of OSU' successfully showed in the Ohio Union's performance hall. Eventually, we had more than 400 audiences in the performance hall, which is a decent way to prove the Echo Studio's influence power in the international student group.We are a student group that will never be discriminative on the basis of age, ancestry, color, disability, gender identity or expression, genetic information, HIV/AIDS status, military status, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, protected veteran status, etc. We welcome all individuals to join our family.",

"Purpose_Statement" : "	Eco-Peace is an Ohio State club that represents the standard of excellence that students feel toward the love of the Earth and their campus.  Our mission is to work towards a greener OSU through clean-ups, sustainability practices, and environmental social encouragement.  From understanding our past; the problems we have made in respect to the kindness we show the Earth that birthed us, we work towards fixing our mistakes and ensuring that the next generation will be better off than us.  Everything we do is in order to enjoy life to its fullest extent, not only for ourselves and the rest of humanity, but for all the animals and plants we share our home with.  We stand for love, fun, and kindness toward all.	We do all this through weekly trash pickups on campus. We also do everything we can not only through treatment, but also through prevention. On top of all of that we have a strong social campaign that stands for and encourages all students to treat their campus like their home and ensure that it is clean and healthy.  Finally, our future goals are to eventually work with the faculty and administration to make OSU a completely green campus with zero waste.	This club was founded from the upsetting state of campus in concern to the amount of pollution and disregard for the environment.  We feel the responsibility as a high standing university to do as much good as possible in respect to caring for nature, especially considering the unfortunate condition we allowed it to get to.  We aim to restore campus to its natural beauty and elegance.  This will do good not only for Ohio State but we hope, as OSU traditionally does, it will set a standard for universities all over the nation and the world to treat our environment with the same level of respect that it does for us and then some to make up for the travesties we have caused Earth in the past.  Peace and Love!",

EWB-OSU is the student led chapter at The Ohio State University of the national organization.  EWB-OSU provides professional development, real world engineering service projects, and networking to its members. We have recently completed the implementation phase of our international project located in N'jau, The Gambia. This project is dealing with access a sustainable water source for agricultural purposes and we will be traveling in the future to monitor and evaluate the progress of this project. We are starting a new structural project in Carrera, Ecuador to build an addition for a school. This project is in the community assessment phase and our chapter plans on traveling to Ecuador at least once a year to implement the project and evaluate the progress. Our local projects teams work with a variety of organizations in central Ohio including Green Columbus, Friends of the Olentangy Watershed, CHA Animal Shelter and more. Local projects provides many opportunities for hands-on experiences in our own community, including through the many volunteering events we host every semester. Current local projects include designing and producing accessible bilateral stimulation tappers, creating and implementing a bike powered pump for harvesting water from barrels for a tree nursery, and design a community garden for South Side Family Farms. Our fundraising, marketing, and social teams work to provide funding for our projects as well as keep our members excited and engaged.",

"Purpose_Statement" : "The specialty of family medicine has a wide breadth intended to provide comprehensive care to all body systems of patients of all ages, in all ranges of severity. As a field uniquely positioned to appreciate the needs of the whole person and community, family medicine is rapidly increasing its use of ultrasound as a means of portable, quick, easy-to-teach imaging that provides information to make diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. Our organization brings together learners of ultrasound of all stages and skill levels, including undergraduate, professional/graduate students with resident and attending faculty and practicing physicians. We recognize the importance of a learning pipeline in providing a better future for family medicine patients, and keep in mind the possible use of ultrasound in an outpatient/non-hospital setting, and resource-poor settings. We intend to increase competence and expand knowledge through lectures, hands-on teaching sessions, pretend-patient events requiring ultrasound, and journal clubs. Scans of interest will include abdominal aneurysm screens, ruling out a leg clot, examining the heart and lungs, finding fluid in a trauma, judging fluid build-up in kidneys, thyroid nodules/size, joint injections and exams, pregnancy and mass exams, gallbladder exams, and procedural guidance, with a significantly greater emphasis on non-emergent scanning.",

"Purpose_Statement" : "The Federalist Society at The Ohio State University is an organization interested in free thought and debate on the current state of the legal order.  The Federalist Society is founded on the principles that the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to the Constitution of the United States of America, and that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is—not what it should be.The purpose of The Federalist Society is to promote an awareness of these principles and to further their application through its activities.  This requires restoring the recognition of the importance of norms that place a premium on individual liberty, traditional values, and the rule of law among law students, professors, lawyers, and judges.  In working to achieve these goals, The Federalist Society will work to create an intellectual network that extends to all levels of the legal community.",

The goal of this organization is to create a safe space and community for first-generation medical students where they can receive guidance through medical school and into residency. It serves as a networking tool for first-generation medical students to connect with each other and with faculty members as well, in hopes of creating mentorship opportunities. It also provides opportunities for first-generation medical students to mentor other first-generation pre-medical undergraduates at OSU. With only a small percentage of medical students being first in their family to attend college, it can be challenging for first-generation students to access career information and navigate higher education in medicine due to its competitive nature. Because of this, it is important to create a dedicated community for first-generation students where they can share knowledge with one another and foster an environment of support.",

"Status" : "Active - New/Re-Established I",
 
"Purpose_Statement" : "Representation matters, and while it is desirable by most to strive to be a flawless Pre-Physician Assistant (PA) undergraduate student and applicant to Physician Assistant school, it is extremely difficult, especially for those students who are first-generation—a term that is used to describe a person who is the first in their family to break barriers such as finishing high school, attending college, or applying to PA school. Motivated to establish a platform for those who do not have immediate access to a Physician Assistant mentor and those exclusive resources, the “First-Generation Pre-Physician Assistant Platform” is an Instagram, Youtube, and Spotify Podcast platform that acts as a 24/7 mentorship service for pre-PA students from Ohio State University and beyond. Answered by well-known, resilient, empathetic, and experienced first-generation certified Physician Assistants, PA students, and PA mentors, this platform will reveal the resources and answers to our most common pre-PA fears, which are usually not posted publicly, as we start our pre-PA journeys. This platform’s hope to assure the spiraling worries of the first-generation pre-PA students and to provide them constant access to pre-PA mentorship podcasts, videos, and other forms of resources that will always alleviate their anxieties throughout their journeys. Creating these collections of resources for these pre-PA communities, this platform will increase the access to the resources and treat the necessity of first-generation pre-PA students having a mentor and community to confide in. There, truly, is no greater feeling–community support is a necessity. So within these platforms, we encourage vulnerable conversation from Pre-PA students, PA-S's, and PA-C’s on their personal, non-traditional, first-generation journeys into the Physician Assistant profession. This 24/7 mentorship platform is dedicated to bringing attention to these resources in order to increase the number of underrepresented students interested in medicine. By acknowledging the disparities and setbacks that being first-generation has on collegiate students, this organization has proven that what once seemed impossible, is now becoming reality for first-generation students everywhere.",

"Purpose_Statement" : "We believe that there is a disconnect between Muslim women and maintaining physical well-being. Modesty is an important facet of Islam and maintaining it is a way of strengthening spiritual well-being. However, modesty is often used as an excuse to not workout or be apart of sports due to lack of comfortability and acceptance from society. Our club wants to bridge that gap by showcasing ways you can strengthen physical health while also maintaining modesty, thus strengthening spiritual wellbeing.  We plan to do this by holding wellness events that will include activities such as sports and lessons on nutrition/wellbeing all while tying in faith by incorporating religious based workshops. This organization hopes to create a community of Muslim women looking for a safe space to achieve their physical goals, all while emphasizing that modesty is not a barrier from wellness.",

"Purpose_Statement" : "Purpose:The purpose of Graduate Philosophy of Religion is to create a forum for dialogue amongst graduate students on the subject of philosophy of religion. This subject includes topics like the epistemological status of religious beliefs, arguments for and against the existence of God, the nature of God and God's relation to and activity in the world, the role of religion in society, and the value of religion for human life. It is our belief that having a space to collaborate with our colleagues and peers will generate opportunities for discussions and projects which will advance our understanding of the field. Graduate Philosophy of Religion will help to facilitate projects aimed at combining different methods in other areas of philosophy which can be applied to better understand the phenomena of religion. In addition, Graduate Philosophy of Religion will strive to increase awareness and communication between the disciplines so that graduate students can take advantage of what the disciplines outside of their own have to offer.",

"Purpose_Statement" : "The Health Education Activities and Development Services for the Underprivileged Population (HEADS-UP) works with local non profits and public middle and high schools to develop a sustainable healthcare literacy curriculum for the students attending those schools/programs who are interested in medicine. The purpose of this program is to improve healthcare literacy by means of education, mentorship and resource support for children who are in an educationally, socially and economically disadvantaged position. HEADS-UP will aim to fill the gaps in health education that are not specifically addressed in the school's current academic curriculum.  By doing so - we believe that we can establish a pipeline extending from medical school all the way into 1st grade.  The mainstay of HEADS UP is our work with Ethiopian Tewahedo Social Services (ETSS), a nonprofit focused on providing services to immigrant and refugee families of Columbus, OH.  It is our goal to teach students of the ETSS Youth Summer Program how to build healthy habits that can be applied to their daily life by addressing subjects such as diet and nutrition, exercise, common diseases, and human anatomy. We also hope to provide these students with mentorship (with medical student volunteers) by fostering meaningful and long-lasting relationships through discussion and teaching.",

In addition, introducing our students to the intricacies and writing protocols of the History of Medicine discourse community, is an aim that will come both purposefully and naturally, as journal clubs and literature reviews are conducted.Creating this group of passionate faculty and students amidst the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial in promoting the understanding of the geopolitical, emotional, and social impacts that COVID-19 inevitably has—resembling epidemics of the past.",

"Purpose_Statement" : "In response to the needs of graduate students of various disciplines interested in film studies, the Ohio State University Interdisciplinary Graduate Film Studies Group’s goal is to provide opportunities for viewing, reading, and discussion, as well as support for filmmaking and cinema appreciation efforts throughout campus. Eventually, the club’s mission may expand, since the needs of graduate students invested in cinema studies at OSU are diverse. Since film studies is a relatively young field and has emerged during a complex era in the history of the humanities, many institutions offer coursework in cinema studies on an intermittent, contingent, or supplementary basis only. As a result, graduate students with a scholarly interest in film studies require more engagement in a formal context. IGFSG will provide a forum for graduate students to learn from one another and form connections across disciplines while pursuing academic career development goals related to film studies. The possibilities are as numerous as the quantity of students who choose to become involved.",

Moreover, we intend to organize students to visit top universities to get a more clear idea about their ideal schools. From another respect – career management, we would like to ask officers in the university to teach students the right way to build up resume and stand out in an interview. We will dedicate ourselves to make contact with local companies to strive for internship opportunities for our students. For the sake of long-term development of our organization, we will set up database to gather all the useful information and will upgrade it constantly.

Every year, hundreds of people receive/donate organs, and are expected to seamlessly transition from their current preventative health practices to those of immunocompromised individuals. This task can be rather daunting given the vast amount of information they are expected to absorb and the fact that patients receiving cadaveric organs have minimal forewarning of their operation. The Medical Student Transplant Education Program (MedSTEP) is a volunteer-based program that offers medical students hands-on experience in teaching current transplant patients proper self-care and adjustment to their new organ. In addition, the program serves as a Transplant Interest Group giving students the opportunity to learn about organ donation, and the medical and surgical specialties involved in transplant. MedSTEP facilitates student involvement and education through faculty lectures, shadowing, and connecting medical students interested in transplant research to attending physicians at OSU.",

Using research design as a vehicle, we will communicate fundamental principles of neuroscience such as movement, sensation, memory and learning, neuronal function and the effects of drugs in the brain.  It is our goal that by demystifying neuroscience at an age where students are beginning to form lifelong interests, we will contribute to a better educated public and kindle an interest in basic scientific research.",

To top things off, insurance companies fail to recognize eating disorders as a physical illness, and deny financial assistance. This is why we are here!Project HEAL is a national organization that fundraises to provide treatment grants and spreads awareness and body positivity.As a group of Project HEAL Ambassadors at Ohio State, we also help raise money to send eating disorder patients to treatment, therapy, and nutritional counseling. While raising money, we create bonds on campus to encourage, empower, and support one another to have healthy outlooks on our health, our body image, and our lives.We host small and large fundraisers in addition to meeting bi-weekly on campus. This Spring we raised over $2,900 to send eating disorder patients to treatment! We auctioned off over 100 raffle items from various businesses in the Columbus community in a virtual raffle. We are looking forward to hosting our 7th Gala in the spring of 2022!We have so many great things planned for this coming year, and hope you can join us!",

Additionally, SEAD will provide students with the opportunity to interact with culturally diverse people and to have an impact on their local community through service, education, and activism. SEAD understands that a crucial factor in the preparedness of undergraduates for their graduate and career lives is to increase the communication between the aspiring pre-dentals, dental students, and dental professionals.  To facilitate our goal, SEAD will establish productive relationships with several OSU dental school organizations, OSU dental school professors, and local oral healthcare professionals that have the same passion to inspire change through volunteerism, education, and activism. Guest speakers from the aforementioned groups will equip SEAD members with the background information necessary to contextualize the importance of all the volunteering opportunities throughout the year, and will prepare them for the reality of the modern oral health industry and how they will have to navigate through it in the near future.",

Likewise, we make crafts, draw/paint, and play games with the children. We also try to reach out to the community in efforts to expand and engage others in furthering our program initiatives. We are looking to expand this organization to a larger university to benefit not only the patients, but also the student volunteers who will be able to gain a valuable perspective on serving others and for The Ohio State University to reach out to our surrounding community.",

"Purpose_Statement" : "The purpose of the Society for Philosophy of Science is to create a forum for discussing issues in philosophy of science. Philosophy of science, as a branch of philosophy, tries to understand the aims, methods, principles, and practices of science. These are investigated both on a general level - by focusing on the topics applied to any branch of science, such as theory and evidence, scientific progress and theory change, confirmation, explanation, etc. - and in a more focused way - by looking into each field of science such as physics, biology, psychology, economics, computer science, etc. Issues closely related to science are also the target of study, such as the relationship between science and policy, moral problems in scientific research and technological advance, feminist science, to name a few. Given the apparent success and a huge impact science has made, understanding science - its nature, role, and value - is undoubtedly an important task. And given that societies are becoming more and more driven by scientific research and findings, the task will also become more and more significant. Society for Philosophy of Science aims to facilitate members of the Ohio State community to engage with the said task. For this, this group will provide various opportunities for people thinking about science to share their ideas and to discuss recent and important works in philosophy of science.",

What is the nature of mathematical and logical truth? Which sorts of questions are answerable by science? As there is already substantial interest in these topics among students, alumni, and faculty members, the formation of this group will greatly facilitate a wide variety of people to engage with each other in fruitful discussion.

"Purpose_Statement" : "Alpine Ski and Snowboard Team at the Ohio State University Mission Statement: 	The Alpine Ski and Snowboard Team at the Ohio State University is a way for snow enthusiasts of all ability levels to enjoy the mountains of Ohio.  The team competes in slalom, giant slalom racing, and freestyle; for both skiers and snowboarders.  There are men’s and women’s teams for both skiing and snowboarding.  Racing is encouraged, but not required.Prior racing experience is not required to be on the team; most people in the club have never raced before college.  The Alpine Ski and Snowboard Team encourages anyone who wants to actually enjoy winter semester to see what the team is about. The team practices whenever there is snow on the ground at Snow Trails and Mad River Mountain.  For those who want to ski or snowboard more often, someone from the club is at the ski resorts almost any day of the week, and are wiling to carpool as well.  For those who are worried about the time commitment, nothing the club does is mandatory.The team participates in multiple competitions each year. For those who are interested in serious competition, the club is registered with the United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association (USCSA), and can participate in Regional National competitions. Please visit the club website at www.skiosu.com or check our Facebook page facebook.com/skiosu for more information about the Alpine Ski and Snowboard Team (OSU Ski Team) at the Ohio State University.",

"Purpose_Statement" : "Minority populations in America, namely African American and Hispanic, are growing faster than any other population group. However, this growth has not been witnessed in the number of health professionals in this country, including dental and medical students and faculty. Currently there are 34 million African Americans, approximately twelve percent of the general population, yet they only represent one percent of dentists in this country. With these figures in mind, one can begin to understand the current disparities in the health status of minority populations compared with the general populations.  The mission of our group is firmly rooted in the ideals of recruitment, retention, and professional transition with a focus on rights, interest, and welfare of future dental professionals.  Over the years, our prominent organization has risen to the challenges of identifying and representing the concerns of underrepresented minorities in dental schools across the nation.  The SNDA will help to reverse the drastic decline in minority application and enrollment in our dental institutions.",

"Purpose_Statement" : "The Ohio State University Student’s for Justice in Palestine is a democratic student organization, whose main focus is the liberation and self-determinism of the Palestinian people; this includes Palestinians within Israel, the Occupied Territories, and diaspora. SJP believes that a crucial step towards a practical political solution relies on justice not only for some, but for all as equal citizens.We condemn Israel’s non-compliance with international law.We firmly reject the apartheid system Palestinians in the territories have and continue to live under. We affirm that all peoples are entitled to human rights and the protection of international law. We oppose all forms of racism, including but not limited to, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and white supremacy.We oppose all forms of oppression towards marginalized groups globally; particularly we emphasize our solidarity with other oppressed indigenous peoples. We understand that our struggle is inherently linked to a long history of global colonialism, and seek to find association with groups also working for liberation and recognition.We firmly reject the military occupation as well as all other forms of state and institutionalized violence. This includes the blockade on Gaza, and the West Bank Wall. We condemn repression and affirm our right to self-expression; we stand in solidarity with Israel’s Palestinian political prisoners who are being unjustly held for doing the same.We insist and that the Palestinian Question be answered with Palestinian self-determinism. We seek to create a dialogue on the Palestinian perspective and encourage all to participate with us.SJP recognizes and supports the 2005 call to boycott, divest, and sanction. BDS should be should be maintained until Israel meets its obligation to recognize the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to self-determination and fully complies with the precepts of international law by:1. Ending its occupation and colonization of all Arab lands, dismantling the Wall and freeing all Palestinian and Arab political prisoners.2. Recognizing the fundamental rights of the Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality; and,3. Respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN General Assembly resolution 194",

"Purpose_Statement" : "The group Talking is Medicine (TiM) is meant to promote the broader use of techniques practiced by different talk therapies in fields of medicine beyond psychiatry. We believe aspects of these talk therapies can be applied to the way physicians approach and handle patients in all fields. While medicine as a discipline has been moving towards a more “patient centered” model of care in recent years, we believe doctors can go a step beyond just providing individualized care for physical symptoms. We believe to truly serve our patients, doctors should grow a more profound relationship with them built on empathy and deep, personal understanding. In this way doctors can become more intricately aware of their patients’ needs, allowing them to provide the best in personalized care. TiM aims to provide opportunities for students to learn and practice aspects of different talk therapies and mindfulness in order to improve their ability to connect with, and in extension, treat patients in clinical encounters. Students are also encouraged to come up with other unique ideas related to our mission and execute them through this group. For more information, please email ?osucomTiM@gmail.com.",

"Purpose_Statement" : "The U-CAN organization aims to utilize community engagement to empower homeless women and children in the Columbus community through collaboration, advocacy and networking. The goal of the organization is to implement programs focused on minimizing disparities in healthcare accessibility through education on various healthcare topics including skin, breast and reproductive health by providing empowerment workshops in partnership with local homeless shelters. This organization will utilize established relations with The Ohio State College of Medicine faculty to provide on-site physicians to participate in community engagement events, thus simultaneously creating a pipeline for graduate organization members interested in healthcare to build connections and network early in their careers with physician mentors passionate about healthcare advocacy. Through providing graduate students with early experience engaging with diverse populations, we aim to foster the creation of a future workforce that is conscious of societal and structural barriers to health accessibility and motivated to act as agents for change.",

Medicine is in a time of flux as the number of female physicians rises in a historically male-dominated profession.  This changing climate provides an opportunity to redefine roles and expectations for the best interest of all physicians, whether female or male.  Our goal is to highlight topics relevant to both genders that are not typically discussed in other settings. In addition, we aim to establish opportunities for mentorship among women who are dedicated to pursuing medical careers. It is not aimed at women only, for we strive to attain cohesiveness between the genders and discuss issues that each faces both together and separately. Finally, we aim to utilize our platform to promote women’s health issues in the community.",
